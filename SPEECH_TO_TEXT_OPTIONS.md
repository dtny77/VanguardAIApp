## üîß **Configuration**

Create a `.env` file (copy from `.env.example`):

```bash
# Choose your provider
SPEECH_PROVIDER=native  # or 'google', 'openai', 'mock'

# Add API keys only for the provider you choose
GOOGLE_CLOUD_API_KEY=your_google_key_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
```

---

## üéØ **Recommendation**

**For most users**: Start with `native` (free, works immediately)
**For better accuracy**: Upgrade to `google` (generous free tier)
**For best accuracy**: Use `openai` (most expensive but best results)

---

## üîä **How It Works**

1. **Press microphone button** üé§
2. **Start speaking** - see "Listening..." in input field
3. **Real-time transcription** - text appears as you speak
4. **Press microphone again or Send** to stop

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Advanced Configuration**

In `config.ts`, you can customize:

```typescript
export const SPEECH_CONFIG = {
  PROVIDER: 'native',           // Provider choice
  LANGUAGE: 'en-US',           // Language code
  CONTINUOUS: true,            // Keep listening
  INTERIM_RESULTS: true,       // Show partial results
};
```

---

## üö® **Troubleshooting**

### "Failed to start recording"
- Check microphone permissions
- Make sure no other app is using mic

### No transcription appearing
- Verify API key is correct (for cloud providers)
- Check internet connection (for cloud providers)
- Try native provider as fallback

### Poor accuracy
- Speak clearly and at normal volume
- Use in quiet environment
- Consider upgrading to cloud provider

---

## üí° **Tips for Best Results**

1. **Speak clearly** at normal pace
2. **Quiet environment** reduces errors
3. **6-12 inches** from device microphone
4. **Wait for "Listening..."** before speaking
5. **Pause briefly** between sentences

---

## üîÆ **Future Enhancements**

We're considering adding:
- Azure Speech Services
- AWS Transcribe
- Offline speech models
- Custom language models
- Multiple language support
